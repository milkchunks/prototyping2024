# Timeline

## Day 1 (11/18)

### What did you do?
Created basic collector methods like setting and getting pivot position, setting/getting velocity for collector spin motor, setting/getting collect/deploy states,
did motor configs, and put in arbitrary constants. 

Edit later that night: Added collector commands, created/implemented OI, commented a bunch of collector code except for the subsystem itself, and added gear ratios/a sensor to mechanism coefficient with questionable accuracy.

### What challenges did you have?
Understanding the TalonFX.set() method and what it wants for its parameter.

Edit later that night: 
- Handling any sorts of errors with commands and position tolerances
- Scheduling commands themselves (i hope CommandScheduler.getInstance().schedule() works)
- Voltage and when to use/not use it :(
- Feedforward

### What do you plan to do tomorrow?
Finish setting/getting states, hopefully finish the collector subsystem, start and hopefully finish basic collector commands like zero, eject, etc. Maybe even get started on putting commands/data on SmartDashboard for testing?

Edit later that night: ADD ROBOTCONTAINER, start on indexer, review and polish collector, put commands/data on SmartDashboard for testing, and write a collector zero command if that's even necessary.
