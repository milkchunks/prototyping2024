# Timeline

## Day 1 (11/18)

### What did you do?
Created basic collector methods like setting and getting pivot position, setting/getting velocity for collector spin motor, setting/getting collect/deploy states,
did motor configs, and put in arbitrary constants.

### What challenges did you have?
Understanding the TalonFX.set() method and what it wants for its parameter.

### What do you plan to do tomorrow?
Finish setting/getting states, hopefully finish the collector subsystem, start and hopefully finish basic collector commands like zero, eject, etc. Maybe even get started on putting commands/data on SmartDashboard for testing?
